<!-- After running your code, if you will right-click anywhere in the browser then you will see an inspect element option. By clicking on it you will be able to see the original code. From here you can make some changes in the webpage and can observe it. However, it does not change the original code on your server. Developer Tools are used to make any changes into your code and see the instant effect on your web page. This change is not a permanent. -->

<!-- But if you like any change made in the developer tools, you can do the same in original file in VS code and refresh the page. That particular change will now reflect back permanently. Inspect Element allows us to make and view the changes in any of the websites present all over the world -->

<!-- Some tips while defining a color class:-

Do not directly use the name of the color as the class name instead use 

colorprimary 
colorsuccess
colorwarning
As writing these looks more professional and also helps in future to maintain our codes. -->

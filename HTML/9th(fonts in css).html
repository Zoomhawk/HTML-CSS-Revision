<!-- This is a very basic code as an example to start playing around different fonts. In CSS, we have two types of fonts- web-safe fonts and web fonts. Web saved fonts are the fonts that come pre-installed with most of the operating systems, therefore, using these fonts you will never encounter any error. But on the other hand, some fonts are not shipped with the OS; so to use them, we need to import them from the web. -->
